                        <p>
                            Panels are often used in clinical settings because they’re low cost and provide high quality coverage
                            of specific, pre-defined genomic regions of interest. While useful in certain settings, such assays are limited by their narrow focus.
                            With ≥ 99.5% call rate across ~600 genes relevant
                            to many disease states, the Exome+ assay enables you to run multiple panel-grade analyses with a single sample.

And, while we have ensured the highest call rates across those genes that are most likely to belong to a panel, the Exome+ assay delivers high call rates for all genes beyond this core set.
